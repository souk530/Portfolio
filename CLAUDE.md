# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a simple portfolio configuration file in JSON format. The `link.json` file stores links to various web applications and projects, primarily in Japanese, including:

- Payment applications (QR code payment app)
- SDGs Fair websites and survey applications  
- Tourism and stamp rally applications

## File Structure

- `link.json` - Main configuration file containing project names and their corresponding URLs

## Architecture

This is a minimal configuration repository with a single JSON file that serves as a link directory or portfolio index. The structure suggests this may be used as a reference file for a portfolio website or application that displays links to various deployed projects.

The projects referenced appear to be deployed on Vercel and include various civic and commercial applications developed for Japanese organizations and events.
